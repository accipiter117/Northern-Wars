## M1 acceptance criteria
- The page loads on GitHub Pages and runs on a phone in portrait and landscape.
- Temeria, neighbouring lands, terrain zones, rivers, Lake Vizima, roads and all settlements render from data/geography.json, with names.
- Pan, pinch zoom and tap work. Tapping a settlement opens its card (name, type, population, holder; placeholder values are fine).
- The calendar advances in real time; pause, 1x, 2x and 4x work; the date and season show in the top bar.
- Ambient caravans and patrols travel the road network and barges move on the Pontar and Ismena; tapping a unit shows what it is.
- Save and load work via localStorage, plus JSON export and import.
- npm test passes: sim tests, the 10-year headless run, and Playwright smoke tests with screenshots in portrait and landscape.

## M2 acceptance criteria
- Every settlement keeps its own stores of food, timber, stone and iron; the realm totals are their sum.
- Food is grown on a harvest-shaped curve, eaten (more in winter), shipped from full stores to empty ones, and spoils beyond storage.
- Buildings are ordered from the settlement card, cost coin and materials, take days, and change yields, storage, trade, prosperity or unrest.
- A monthly ledger lists taxes, trade and sales against garrisons, upkeep, the court and interest, with a year of history.
- The treasury can go into debt up to the bankers' limit, at a cost in interest and Authority; past the limit garrisons go unpaid and desert.
- Population grows with prosperity and falls with hunger and high unrest.
- Caravans follow trade volume and grain carts follow real food shipments.
- Version 1 saves load and are upgraded.
